This is my original lecture in which 
I explain the finite element method (FEM / FEA) 
using the example of a simple system with 
three elements in a plane stress state.

I did the computations (code) in sagemath (95% python + 5% C) language.
I compare the results to a commercial solution in the ARSAP (Autodesk) system.

My lecture, supported by an example, allows students 
to understand the essence of FEA in the displacement approach. 
It is aimed mainly at civil engineers 
who sometimes treat FEA systems as black boxes.
